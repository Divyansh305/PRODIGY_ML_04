Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition

This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify various hand gestures from image or video data. The primary goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
Project Overview

The hand gesture recognition system is designed to recognize gestures such as thumbs up, peace sign, pointing, and more. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model extracts meaningful features from hand gesture images and classifies them effectively.
Key Features

    Gesture Recognition: Classifies various hand gestures accurately.
    Deep Learning: Utilizes CNNs to learn features from hand gesture images.
    Real-time Interaction: Capable of recognizing gestures from live video feeds or images.
    User-Friendly Interface: Facilitates intuitive interaction between users and devices.
